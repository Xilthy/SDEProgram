## Singleton mode
Singleton1 is a lazy man model. It will not be instantiated at the beginning. It will be instantiated when it is used. Singleton1 is a hungry man mode. It has been instantiated at the beginning of class loading and creates a singleton object, which will only work in the future.
## Builder Pattern
The builder pattern uses multiple simple objects to build a complex object step by step. Builder: create and provide instances, director: manage the dependencies of the created instances.

## Work Distribution
Both creational design patterns were implemented by Yigit. The explanation of each pattern (Singleton and Builder patterns) is included in this readme.
